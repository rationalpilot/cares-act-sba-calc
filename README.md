An excel to help small businesses determine loans amounts and forgiveness from the recently passed Cares Act. This is what we used as a draft and thought other SMB's might find it useful.  

Not totally comprehensive, but will give an estimate of your loan amount and forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program.
